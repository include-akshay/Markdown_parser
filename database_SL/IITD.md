Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IIT Delhi) is an autonomous globally acclaimed public research and engineering institute located in Hauz Khas in South Delhi, Delhi, India. It is one of the oldest Indian Institutes of Technology in India.

Established in 1961, was formally inaugurated in August 1961 by Prof. Humayun Kabir, Minister of Scientific Research & Cultural Affairs. First admissions were made in 1961.[5] The current campus has an area of 320 acres (or 1.3 km2) and is bounded by the Sri Aurobindo Marg on the east, the Jawaharlal Nehru University Complex on the west, the National Council of Educational Research and Training on the south, and the New Ring Road on the north, and flanked by Qutub Minar and the Hauz Khas monuments.[4]

The institute was later decreed in the Institutes of National Importance under the Institutes of Technology Amendment Act, 1963, and accorded the status of a full University with powers to decide its academic policy, conduct its examinations, and award its degrees.
In 2018 IIT Delhi was also given the status of Institution of Eminence (IoE) by the Government of India which granted almost-full autonomy. According to a government statement issued earlier, these IoEs will have greater autonomy in that they will be able to admit foreign students up to 30% of the admitted students and recruit foreign faculty up to 25% of the faculty strength with enhanced research funding.
