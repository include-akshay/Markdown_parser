# IIT GUWAHATI

The history of IIT Guwahati traces its roots to the 1985 Assam Accord[7] signed between the All Assam Students Union and the Government of India, which mentions the general improvement in education facilities in Assam and specifically the setting up of an IIT.

IIT Guwahati was established in 1994 by an act of parliament and its academic programme commenced in 1995.[1] IIT Guwahati admitted its first batch of students into its Bachelor of Technology programme in 1995. The selection process was the same as that of the other IITs, i.e., through the Joint Entrance Examination.[8] In 1998, the first batch of students were accepted into the Master of Technology program through the GATE.
